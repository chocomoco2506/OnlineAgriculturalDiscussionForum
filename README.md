# OnlineAgriculturalDiscussionForum
C#,Asp.net Project
Developed an Online Agricultural Discussion Forum using C# and ASP.NET to provide a platform for farmers, agricultural professionals, and small-scale growers to connect, share knowledge, and discuss farming-related topics. The forum enables users to post questions, share experiences, and exchange advice on crop cultivation, livestock management, and sustainable farming practices. Key features include user authentication, threaded discussions, and real-time notifications. This project highlights my skills in web development, database integration, and creating user-friendly interfaces tailored to specific industries.
